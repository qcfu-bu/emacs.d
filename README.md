# My Horrible Emacs Configuration

This configuration aims to implement a minimal subset of spacemacs/doom SPC
based key-bindings to vanilla emacs. The two core packages that make
this possible are evil-mode and general-mode.

The configuration is intentionally dumb, because I am dumb.

Tested on Emacs 27.1.

# A Minimal Emacs Configuration

This configuration aims to implement a minimal subset of spacemacs/doom SPC
based key-bindings to vanilla emacs. The two core packages that make
this possible are evil-mode and general-mode.

Eye-candy is provided by the beautiful elegant-emacs themes.

Tested on Emacs 27.1.
